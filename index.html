                <p class="lead">Post mortem library</p>

<p>The library after death is based on an unimaginable structure of human thinking. This library has no place in the organization of any of the institutions. The eternal library is not tied to any age, so its books cannot be read. So the library does not exist, but for those who read this article it may become existing.</p>



<p>Fiction Library User Policy</p>

<p>1. The user can never be a historian of his own age, because that would confuse his opposition between the beings and mean the end of history.</p>

<p>2. The user can stand out from the minority caused by himself only with sufficient self-education and art education. In this way, the user can move from existence to a greater degree of existence. Then you can destroy it all by destroying it and start building from scratch.</p>

<p>3. The user must create a time consciousness that finds its place in an autopoietic system.</p>

<p>The relationship between text and the reader</p>

<p>The relationship between the reader and the text is influenced by the author himself. The role of the author is diminished in the case of the post-mortem library, which also means the death of the author.</p>

Here it is the reader who can revive the tragedy of this passing. But this requires a reinterpretation of the author’s text that cannot be done with the tools of fiction. It is only through pictorial philosophical tools that the author becomes livable. So, there is a need for hermeneutics here with pictorial anthropological explanations.</p>

For example, if we want to read Christian Morgenstern’s poem The Shoes, we must first understand the postmodern view of space (which in this case we can do at this link).</p>
